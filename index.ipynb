The cones are sensitive to color and are located mainly in the back of the eye (in the fovea). The rods (distributed throughout the retina), much more numerous than the cones (it is estimated that the number of cones in one eye is 6 or 7 million, while the number of cones ranges between 75 and 150 million), are not sensitive to color.\n",

    "* The cones give us the photopic vision (or bright light) that is what we use in situations with sufficient light intensity. In addition, each cone is connected to a nervous termination so the level of visual resolution of the fovea (where the most important part of the visual scene is located) is high. Rods, although more numerous than cones, are connected in groups to the nerve endings. This reduces the amount of detail discernible with them although given their large number and their retinal distribution they give us a general view of the scene. In situations of low light intensity, only the rods are active (low vision or scotch) and it is not possible to distinguish colors.\n",
